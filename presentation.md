# LoopBack Intro

* Quickly cerate REST APIs
* Based on Express.js
* Model-driven development
* IBM bought StrongLoop in 2015 and integrates LoopBack in their cloud offer (IBM API Connect)
* Comes with Android, iOS and Angular(JS) SDKs
* http://loopback.io

# LoopBack SDK Builder Intro

* A fork from the official AngularJS SDK to support Angular 2
* Generates front-end code to acccess back-end endpoints

```
this.accountApi.patchAttributes(userId, { email: newEmail });
```

* Real-time communication via FireLoop (think FireBase but with your own stack)
* ngrx and ORM support
* https://github.com/mean-expert-official/loopback-sdk-builder

# Get started with LoopBack CLI

Generate LoopBack app:
```
$ npm install -g loopback-cli
$ lb
? What's the name of your application? the-next-big-thing
? Enter name of the directory to contain the project: the-next-big-thing

? Which version of LoopBack would you like to use? 3.x (current)
? What kind of application do you have in mind?
                   api-server (A LoopBack API server with local User auth)

I'm all done. Running npm install for you to install the required dependencies.
If this fails, try running the command yourself.
```

# Windows preparation

* Two steps before building loopack-cli
* Install windows-build-tools
```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```` 

* Install OpenSSL version 1.0.2L: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

---

# Setup database

```
$ lb datasource
? Enter the data-source name: postgres
? Select the connector for postgres: PostgreSQL (supported by StrongLoop)
[...]
```

* Support for different database types as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
* Installs a LoopBack Connector module
* Configure via JSON files (datasources.json)
* Mail is "datasource", too

---

# Generate models

```
$ lb model
```

* Models consist of JSON description and optional JS
* Make a model public and you will get all the REST endpoints
* Fined-gained control to disable and restrict endpoints
* Access Control Lists to allow access to user roles
* Define model relations
* Custom remote methods
* LoopBack API Explorer to exercise all the generated API endpoints

---

![bg](images/slide_bg.png)

# Generate Angular SDK

```
$ npm install --save @mean-expert/loopback-sdk-builder
$ ./node_modules/.bin/lb-sdk server/server.js client/src/app/shared/sdk
```

* NativeScript support
* Real-time communication support
* React support :P
* Generates front-end code for:
  * Models
  * Services
  * Local storage (for auth)

---

# Access Control, Users and Roles

```
{
  "accessType": "WRITE",
  "principalType": "ROLE",
  "principalId": "$owner",
  "permission": "ALLOW"
}    
```

* LoopBack comes with a User model and supports authentication
* Authentication is also available in Angular SDK (```LoopBackAuth``` and ```UserApi``` services)
* Built-in dynamic roles: $everyone, $authenticated, $unauthenticated, $owner
* You can specify static user roles (e.g. 'admin') and dynamic role handlers (e.g. 'teamMember')
* Access to REST endpoints and remote methods is controled via ACLs

---

# Related models and queries

```
this.orderApi.findById(id, { include: [ { relation: 'items',
  scope: { order: 'id DESC' } } ] }).subscribe([...]);
```

* Create model relations with hasMany, hasOne, belongsTo, HasAndBelongsToMany, ...
* LoopBack will publish REST endpoints for those
  (```GET /<model1-name>/<instanceID>/<model2-name>```)
* LoopBack adds helper methods to model class's prototype
  (```order.items(function(err, items) { [...] })```)
* Powerful `include` filter supports nested queries (compare GraphQL)

# The Angular+LoopBack Seed

* Basic full-stack app with User registration, login and profile page
* Extend to your needs!
* https://github.com/ng-lisbon/angular-loopback-seed

# Angular SDK + NGRX (Redux)
```
lb-sdk ... -l angular2 -d ng2web -n [ngrx|orm]
```
* Generates:
  * Actions
  * Effects
  * Reducers
  * Guards and Resolvers
  * ORM*
  * Plugable State

* only for orm flag

---

![bg](images/slide_bg.png)

# Extendable NGRX

* Actions: **Action**, **ActionSuccess**, **ActionFail**. With ```{meta: any}```.
* Effects consume **Action** and dispatch **ActionSuccess** or **ActionFail**
* Reducers consume **ActionSuccess**

You can use any to create you own functionality with custom Effects and Reducers

```typescript
@Effect()
public signupSuccess$ = this.actions$
  .ofType(UserActionTypes.SIGNUP_SUCCESS)
  .map((action: LoopbackAction) => new UserActions.login({
    email: action.payload.credentials.email,
    password: action.payload.credentials.password
  }, ['user']))
```
* You can pass any **meta tag** to actions for extra functionality.
* Meta tags will be pass on between actions

---

# Local database representation with ORM

* One **Reducer** per **Model**
* Relation's data resolved to it's **Reducer**
* **ORM** query aggregates data from local **Store**

```
this.orm.Room.find({ include: ['messages'] })
```
```json
[{
  id: 1,
  name: 'ng-lisbon',
  messages: [{ id: 1, text: 'Hello NG-Lisbon' }]
}]
```
```json
rooms: { ids: [...], entities: {...} },
messages: { ids: [...], entities: {...} }
```

---

![bg](images/slide_bg.png)

# ORM special meta tags

* ```{ io: true }```
  * tells **ORM** to **Sync** the query with the server using Fireloop Real-Time API
* ```{ justCache: true }```
  * uses only local **State** bypassing the query to the backend
* ```{ resetStore: true }``` (comming soon)
  * resets the **Store** before applying new **State**

---

![bg](images/slide_bg.png)

# ORM by example

```
this.rooms$ = this.orm.Room.find({
  where: {
    name: { like: 'ng-lisbon' }
  },
  order: 'id DESC',
  limit: 10,
  include: ['categories', 'accounts', 'messages', 'likes']
}, {
  io: true
})
```

* io meta tag tells ORM to sync the query with the server using Fireloop Real-Time API
